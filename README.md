### Hi there!

I'm a Mozambican Software Engineer based in Germany.

I wrote my first line of code in 2018, if you're wondering.

Currently, I work as a Software Engineer for Mobile at Payback, part of American Express.

Previousy, I worked as an Android Software Engineer at [WIT Software](https://www.wit-software.com/), building the [M-Pesa App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.safaricom.mpesa.lifestyle) for Kenya and as a Mobile Engineer at [Retrica](https://retrica.co/).

In the period of **2020 - 2021**, I have been a [Google Developer Student Clubs Lead](https://developers.google.com/community/gdsc/leads) for Universidade SÃ£o TomÃ¡s de MoÃ§ambique and I used to build [AlugAqui](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.calleb.alugaqui). An app that provides the best experience for people looking for rental properties in Mozambique.
